## Discuss how someone could find M or P, given (only) L, how may someone “guess” that steganography has been used? 

If someone only has information about the modulation rate (L) used in steganography, it can still be challenging to uncover both the hidden message (M) and the carrier file (P). However, certain clues may indicate the presence of steganography. For instance, if the file exhibits unusual patterns or inconsistencies, such as unexpected fluctuations in file size or irregularities in pixel values (for images), suspicions may arise. Additionally, if the modulation rate (L) seems arbitrary or is not consistent with typical encoding practices, it could hint at the presence of hidden data. To attempt to uncover the hidden message or carrier file, one might employ steganalysis techniques, which involve analyzing the file for anomalies and using specialized tools to detect alterations made by steganographic methods. However, without prior knowledge of the specific steganographic technique or access to additional information, such as the original carrier file or encryption keys, uncovering the hidden message or carrier file can be a challenging task.
